How to install:

- Make sure your server supports PHP, MySQL

- Make a new directory on your webserver's DocumentRoot
  and unpack this archive to it, for example to ./fwprofile-editor/

- Make sure that the 'tmp' directory is writable by all:
  chmod 0777 ./fwprofile-editor/tmp

- Edit config.php file on server, for example ./fwprofile-editor/config.php
  and make sure to put there correct credentials for MySQL connection.

- Make sure your database is already created. It doesn't need
  to contain any tables yet, the install script will create them.

- Load install.php script in browser, for example by visiting:
  http://www.yourdomain.com/fwprofile-editor/install.php
  It will setup appropriate tables on mysql side if those do not exist yet.
  If there are existing data, they remain untouched.

  If you wish to reinstall the database from scratch, you have to manually
  delete all existing tables and rerun the install.php script again.

- When done, navigate to http://www.yourdomain.com/fwprofile-editor/
  and you will see FW Profile editor there.
