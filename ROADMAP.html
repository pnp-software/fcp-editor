<h1>Ideas and features:</h1>

<li>detect states which are not connected to anything and error on code gen in that case</li>

<li>context menu: - copy, paste, cut, delete, clone, deselect all, undo, redo</li>

<li>shift + click and ctrl+click should add clicked state to selection to select multiple states by one</li>



<li>Scroll bars on paper</li>

<li>Improve firefox performance by converting text elements to paths</li>
