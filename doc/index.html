<h1>FCP Profile Editor Quick Guide</h1>

<p>The FCP Profile Editor is a web-based tool to create, edit, save and share <strong>Flight Control Procedures</strong>
(FCPs) for PUS-based applications. A FCP is a conditional sequence of telecommands and telemetry checks.

<p>FCPs are represented as UML activity diagrams which are created by dragging and dropping pre-defined elements on a canvas.
The editor is customized with a mySQL database which defines the PUS telecommands and telemetry packets in
SCOS-2000 format.
The editor offers auto-completion facilities which allow users to quickly reference telecommands and
telemetry packets and their internal parameters.

<p>FCP models can be shared (either in read-only or in read-write mode) with other users.
They are serialized to a <code>json</code> format which can be exported and which users
can use for further processing (e.g. to generate a test sequence implementing an FCP).

<p>Although the FCP Editor was developed with Flight Control Procedures in mind, it can be
used to model any kind of control procedure for a PUS application.
For instance, it could be used to define a test procedure or any other
procedure consisting of sequences of telecommands and telemetry checks.

<p>The FCP Editor is a <code>specification-level editor</code>.
It is agnostic about FCPs are implemented.
Users would typically proceed as follows:

<ul>
<li>The FCPs are defined in the editor</li>
<li>The FCP models (representing the formal specification of the FCPs) are 
exported in <code>json</code> format</li>
<li>The <code>json</code> models are processed to generate the implementation of the FCPs</li>
</ul>


<p>The FCP Editor is based on the <a href="https://www.pnp-software.com/fwprofile/editor/">FW Profile Editor</a>.
Users are referred to the online help of the FW Profile Editor for information about how
to edit diagrams (but the interface of the editor is very intuitive and most users
will be able to find out what they need by trail-and-error).
This online help focuses on the FCP-specific features of the FCP Editor.

</div>

        <h2 id=modelattributes>Model Attributes</h2>
        <p>The attributes of an FCP are defined in its "Global Properties" table.
        Users can define for each FCP:
        
        <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Project Name (useful if the editor is used for multiple project)</li>
        <li>Pre-Conditions</li>
        <li>Post-Conditions</li>
        <li>One or more input parameters</li>
        <li>Generic text notes (e.g. description of the FCP)</li>
        <li>Version of the <a href="#scosdatabase">SCOS Database</a> on which the model is built</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2 id=scosdatabase>SCOS Database</h2>
        The SCOS Database must be installed on the mySQL server where the FCP Editor models reside.
        Its name must start with "SCOS_". 
        There may be more than SCOS databases installed at any given time, either because
        the editor is used for multiple applications with different TM/TC interfaces, or
        because the editor is used with multiple versions of the TM/TC interface.
        
        <p>If no SCOS Database in installed, the editor can be used as a generic editor
        for UML Activity Diagrams.
        
        <p>The SCOS database selection is an attribute of each model.
        It appears in a pull-down menu at the bottom of the model's "Global Properties" table.
        Like all other model attributes, the database selection is also stored in
        the model's <code>json</code> serialization.
        
        
        <h2 id=scosdatabaseloading>SCOS Database Loading</h2>
        The SCOS database can be uploaded either as an *.sql file or as a zip file which holds
        the SCOS tables in csv format. The upload can only be done by the "example" user.
        The "example" user is configured in the configuration file <code>config_user.php</code>.
        The "example" user uploads the SCOS database by logging at: 
        <code>http://www.yourdomain.com/fcp-editor/users.php</code>. 
        The figure shows the upload page. The user must specify the position within the csv
        tables of the SCOS parameters used by the editor. The editor proposes a default
        configuration but users can edit this default.

        <h2 id=autocompletion>Auto-Completion Facility</h2>
        <p>One important aid in the generation of FCPs is the auto-completion feature of the
        editor.
        Auto-completion is supported for the following PUS design items:
        <ul>
        <li>Telecommand packets</li>
        <li>Telemetry packets</li>
        <li>Telecommand parameters</li>
        <li>Telemetry packet parameters</li>
        <li>Event identifiers</li>
        <li>Housekeeping parameters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The auto-completion feature is continuously active and as soon as it detects
        a string which matches one of its entries, it displays a table with the 
        PUS information about the matching entries.
        For instance. if a user types "TC(192,", the editor responds by generating
        a table as in the figure which display all available service 192 telecommands:
        
           <div class="pull-left" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <img src="TcAutoComp.png" class="pull-left">
           </div>
        <br clear=all>
        
        <p>The user can respond either by ignoring the auto-completion tip and continuiing
        to type or by navigating the auto-completiong table and selecting one entry.
        The displayed text looks as in the figure:
        
           <div class="pull-left" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <img src="TcAutoCompDisp.png" class="pull-left">
           </div>
        <br clear=all>
        
        <p>The text in red font is inserted by the auto-completion feature.
        If the user were to hover over it, a tool-tip would appear with the 
        name of the telecommand.
        
        <p>The next figure shows another example. 
        The user has entered "Send #TC(6,2)" and then he types again "TC(6,2)"
        and the editor offers a list of all TC(6,2) in the system and their parameters.
        This allows the user to easily select the parameters of a telecommand.
        
           <div class="pull-left" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <img src="TcParAutoComp.png" class="pull-left">
           </div>
        <br clear=all>
        
        
        
        
        <h2 id=customization>Customization</h2>
        <p>The FCP Editor back-end is implemented in <code>PHP</code> and the front-end is
        implemented in <code>javascript</code>.
        The editor is available on an open and public licence and users
        are allowed and encouraged to extend it for their own purposes.
        Typical extensions might include:
        
        <ul>
        <li>Extension of auto-completion mechanism to handle other kinds of
            items (e.g. service 1 failure codes or calibration curves for
            TC parameters)</li>
        <li>Implementation of model check function (e.g. to verify 
            consistency with a SCOS Database version or to enforce
            project specific conventions on the definition of PUS items)</li>
        </ul>
