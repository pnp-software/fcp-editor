<h1>FCP Profile Editor Quick Guide</h1>

<p>The FCP Profile Editor is a web-based tool to create, edit, save and share <strong>Flight Control Procedures</strong>
(FCPs) for PUS-based applications. A FCP is a conditional sequence of telecommands and telemetry checks.

<p>FCPs are represented as UML activity diagrams which are created by dragging and dropping pre-defined elements on a canvas.
The editor is customized with either a MySQL database or a set of MIB Tables which define the PUS telecommands and telemetry packets in
SCOS-2000 format.
The editor offers auto-completion facilities which allow users to quickly reference telecommands and
telemetry packets and their internal parameters.

<p>FCP models can be shared (either in read-only or in read-write mode) with other users.
They are serialized to a <code>json</code> format which can be exported and which users
can process further (e.g. to generate a test sequence implementing an FCP).

<p>Although the FCP Editor was developed with Flight Control Procedures in mind, it can be
used to model any kind of control procedure for a PUS application.
For instance, it could be used to define a test procedure or any other
procedure consisting of sequences of telecommands and telemetry checks.

<p>The FCP Editor is a <strong>specification-level editor</strong>.
It is agnostic about how FCPs are implemented.
Users would typically proceed as follows:

<ul>
<li>The FCPs are defined in the editor</li>
<li>The FCP models are exported to <code>json</code> format</li>
<li>The <code>json</code> models are processed to generate the implementation of the FCPs</li>
</ul>


<p>The FCP Editor is based on the <a href="https://www.pnp-software.com/fwprofile/editor/">FW Profile Editor</a>.
Users are referred to the online help of the FW Profile Editor for information about how
to edit diagrams (but the interface of the editor is very intuitive and most users
will be able to find out what they need by trial-and-error).
This online help focuses on the FCP-specific features of the FCP Editor.

</div>

        <h2 id=modelattributes>Model Attributes</h2>
        <p>The attributes of an FCP are defined in its "Global Properties" table.
        Users can define for each FCP:
        
        <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Project Name (useful if the editor is used for multiple project)</li>
        <li>Pre-Conditions</li>
        <li>Post-Conditions</li>
        <li>One or more input parameters</li>
        <li>Generic text notes (e.g. description of the FCP)</li>
        <li>Version of the <a href="#scosdatabase">SCOS Database</a> on which the model is built</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2 id=scosdatabase>SCOS Database</h2>
        <p>The SCOS Database must be installed on the mySQL server where the FCP Editor models reside.
        Its name must start with "SCOS_". 
        There may be more than one SCOS databases installed at any given time, either because
        the editor is used for multiple applications with different TM/TC interfaces, or
        because the editor is used with multiple versions of the TM/TC interface.
        
        <p>If no SCOS Database in installed, the editor can be used as a generic editor
        for UML Activity Diagrams.
        
        <p>The SCOS database selection is an attribute of each model.
        It appears in a pull-down menu at the bottom of the model's "Global Properties" table.
        Like all other model attributes, the database selection is also stored in
        the model's <code>json</code> serialization.
        
        
        <h2 id=scosdatabaseloading>SCOS Database Loading</h2>
        <p>The SCOS database can be uploaded either as an *.sql file or as a zip file which holds
        the SCOS tables in csv format (MIB Tables). 
        
        <p>The *.sql database is loaded in the MySQL server of the editor. Its name must start
        with "SCOS_".
        
        <p>The upload of the SCOS tables as a zip file can only be done by the <code>example</code> user.
        The <code>example</code> user is configured in the editor's configuration file <code>config_user.php</code>.
        The <code>example</code> user uploads the SCOS database by visiting: 
        <code>http://www.yourdomain.com/fcp-editor/users.php</code>. 
        The figure shows the upload page. The user must specify the position within the csv
        tables of the SCOS parameters used by the editor. The editor proposes a default
        configuration but users can edit this default.
        
        <p>The NNAME and NDESCR fields in the table are non-standard (i.e. they are not defined by the SCOS
        standard). The NNAME field represents a "nice name" and is a varchar(64). 
        The NDESCR field represents a "nice description" and is a text field with unlimited length. 
        The "nice name" must be unique.
        
           <div class="pull-left" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <img src="ScosDbUpload.png" class="pull-left">
           </div>
        <br clear=all>

        
        
        <h2 id=autocompletion>Auto-Completion Facility</h2>
        <p>One important aid in the generation of FCPs is the auto-completion feature of the
        editor.
        Auto-completion is supported for the following PUS design items:
        <ul>
        <li>Telecommand packets</li>
        <li>Telemetry packets</li>
        <li>Telecommand parameters</li>
        <li>Telemetry packet parameters</li>
        <li>Event identifiers</li>
        <li>Housekeeping parameters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The auto-completion feature is continuously active and as soon as it detects
        a string which matches one of its entries, it displays a table with the 
        PUS information about the matching entries.
        For instance. if a user types "TC(192,", the editor responds by generating
        a table as in the figure which displays all available service 192 telecommands:
        
           <div class="pull-left" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <img src="TcAutoComp.png" class="pull-left">
           </div>
        <br clear=all>
        
        <p>The user can respond either by ignoring the auto-completion tip and continuiing
        to type or by navigating the auto-completiong table and selecting one entry.
        The displayed text looks as in the figure:
        
           <div class="pull-left" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <img src="TcAutoCompDisp.png" class="pull-left">
           </div>
        <br clear=all>
        
        <p>The text in red font is inserted by the auto-completion feature.
        If the user were to hover over it, a tool-tip would appear with the 
        name of the telecommand.
        
        <p>The next figure shows another example. 
        The user has entered "Send #TC(6,2)" and then he types again "TC(6,2)"
        and the editor offers a list of all TC(6,2) in the system and their parameters.
        This allows the user to easily select the parameters of a telecommand.
        
           <div class="pull-left" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <img src="TcParAutoComp.png" class="pull-left">
           </div>
        <br clear=all>
        
        The auto-completion lists take the form of tables with three columns. 
        The users selects an entry from the list and the entry is displayed 
        as a hyperlink with a tooltip. 
        Hence, for each item in an autocompletion list, one must define:
        <ul>
        <li>The content of the three columns in the autocompletion table</li>
        <li>The text which is displayed when an autocompletion entry is selected 
        by the user</li>
        <li>The text in the tooltip</li>
        </ul>
        The mapping from the SCOS fields to the above elementd is done in
        <code>autocomplete.js</code>.
    
        
        <h2 id=singleModelCheck>Single Model Check</h2>
        <p>Models created by the FCP Editor will probably need to be processed 
        by a script to create an executable test sequence or flight procedure. 
        In order to facilitate the development of such a script, it is useful 
        to define some rules on how the model should be built and it is useful 
        to have these rules verified automatically.
        For this purpose, the editor provides the "Check Function" 
        (second icon from the top in the banner at the left of the editor screen).
        
        <p>The rules against which the check is performed are defined in 
        file <code>checks.js</code>. A small number of default rules is
        pre-defined but users can create new rules to fit their needs.
        The pre-defined rules are:
            
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Rule 1</strong>: All references to SCOS items in the 
        text fields of the model (i.e. all strings starting with: 
        "#TC(...", or "#TM(,...", or "#HK:...", or "#EID:...", or 
        "TMPAR:...", or "TCPAR:...") must be valid with respect to the 
        SCOS database selected for the model.</li>
        <li><strong>Rule 2</strong>: Deleted</li>
        <li><strong>Rule 3</strong>: If the Action Description of a node 
        contains a reference to a telecommand "TC(...", it cannot contain 
        references to any other SCOS element</li>
        <li><strong>Rule 4</strong>: If the Action Descriotion of a node 
        contains a reference to a telecommand "TC(...", then the Notes field 
        attached to that node can only contain #TCPAR references which 
        belong to that telecommand.</li>
        <li><strong>Rule 5</strong>: It is not legal for the Guard 
        Description of a control flow to hold a reference to a t
        elecommand "#TC..."</li>
        <li><strong>Rule 6</strong>: Deleted</li>
        <li><strong>Rule 7</strong>: If an Action Description or a Guard 
        Description contains a reference to an Event Packet "#EID:...", 
        then it cannot hold any other SCOS reference</li>
        <li><strong>Rule 8</strong>: If an Action Description or a Guard 
        Description contains a reference to one or more housekeeping 
        parameters "#HK:...", then the only other SCOS reference it may 
        contain is one telemetry packet reference "TM(..." and that packet 
        must contain all the referenced HK parameters. Note that a 
        housekeeping parameter may be contained in several telemetry 
        packets. This rule is illustrated in the figure below which shows 
        a node which references two HK parameters and one HK packet. The 
        two HK parameters must be in the same TM packet.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id=databaseCheck>SCOS Database Check</h2>
        <p>Each FCP Model is created with reference to a specific SCOS database
        instance (the name of the database instance is an attribute of
        the model).
        When the SCOS database is updated, there is a need to check which
        models contain SCOS references which have become invalid.
        This check can be done by selecting the "Files" option on the
        banner at the left of the editor and then navigating to the bottom
        of the pop-up modal to perform the SCOS compatibility check.
        The check scans all models in the user repository and lists those
        which contain SCOS references which are no longer valid with
        respect to a given SCOS database.


        <h2 id=customization>Customization</h2>
        <p>The FCP Editor back-end is implemented in <code>PHP</code> and the front-end is
        implemented in <code>javascript</code>.
        The editor is available on an open and public licence and users
        are allowed and encouraged to extend it for their own purposes.
        Typical extensions might include:
        
        <ul>
        <li>Extension of auto-completion mechanism to handle other kinds of
            items (e.g. service 1 failure codes or calibration curves for
            TC parameters)</li>
        <li>Update of model check function to meet project-specific needs</li>
        <li>Definiton of additional model attributes</li>
        </ul>
